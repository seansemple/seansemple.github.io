    Q1) What did you look up? <br>
    I chose CSS media queries. 
  
  <h1>Q2) What sites did you consult? Include links to the specific pages on those 4 resources.
    https://stackdiary.com/css-media-queries/ <br>
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries<br>
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp<br>
    https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/<br>


  <h1>Q3) What are the differences in the information presented on each site?<br>
    Stackdiary ggives the broadest, most detailed information on media features. <br>
    MDN is the best at teaching concepts and application whereas W3Schools is the simplest <br>
    and sort of like a cheat sheet.
    Lastly, CSS-Tricks focuses on practical application and real-world uses for media queries.

  <h1>Q4)What features do you think a code reference page should offer?  <br>
    Clear definitions and real world applications are really important. I also think good word economy
    is important in technical writing. Additionally, examples that are appropriate are also important.

<h1>Q5)Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?<br>
I think they're all pretty universially good. W3Schools doesn't go too deep into application. <br>
StackDiary is the strongest overall as it feels the most up to date and well written.
