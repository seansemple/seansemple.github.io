  <h1>CSS Color – Media Query Research</h1>

  <h2>Q1) What did you look up?</h2><br>
  <p>I chose CSS media queries.</p>

  <h2>Q2) What sites did you consult? Include links to the specific pages on those 4 resources.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stackdiary.com/css-media-queries/">Stackdiary – CSS Media Queries</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries">MDN – Media Queries</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp">W3Schools – CSS3 Media Queries</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/">CSS-Tricks – Complete Guide to Media Queries</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Q3) What are the differences in the information presented on each site?</h2>
  <p>Stackdiary gives the broadest, most detailed information on media features. <br>MDN is the best at teaching concepts and application, whereas W3Schools is the simplest and sort of like a cheat sheet. <br>Lastly, CSS-Tricks focuses on practical application and real-world uses for media queries.</p>

  <h2>Q4) What features do you think a code reference page should offer?</h2>
  <p>Clear definitions and real world applications are really important. <br>I also think good word economy is important in technical writing. Additionally, appropriate examples are important.</p>

  <h2>Q5) Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?</h2>
  <p>I think they're all pretty universally good. W3Schools doesn't go too deep into application. <br> StackDiary is the strongest overall as it feels the most up to date and well written.</p>
