<h1>Absolute units are lengths that are fixed and do not change depending on other. Examples include: cm, mm, in, pt, and px. These are supposed to represent physical lengths and are useful especially for print or precise layout. <br> Relative units are lengths that depend on something else: theyâ€™re calculated relative to some reference. This makes layouts more adaptable for various screens. Some examples: em, rem, vw, vh, %.</h1>
