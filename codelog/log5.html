  <h1>Q1) What are the differences between &lt;img&gt; and CSS background-image?</h1> <br>
  Meaning: &lt;img&gt; is for content images and should have alt text. <br>
  Meaning: background-image is for decoration and has no alt text. <br>
  Code: &lt;img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description"&gt; <br>
  Code: .box { background-image: url("photo.jpg"); } <br>
  Layout: &lt;img&gt; takes up space as its own box in the layout. <br>
  Layout: a background is painted inside an elementâ€™s box. the element needs width/height to show it. <br>
  
  <h1>Q2) Besides background-image, what CSS properties affect background images?</h1> <br>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  background-size: controls how big the image is. <br>
  background-repeat: repeat the image or not (repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat). <br>
=======
  background-size: controls how big the image is (for example, cover or 150px 100px). <br>
  background-repeat: repeat the image or not (repeat, repeat-x or repeat-y or no-repeat). <br> <br>
>>>>>>> 8202ebcb1bdc423deedcac95d9935174e7e6a6e8
  background-position: where the image sits in the box (center, top right, 10px 20px). <br>
  background-attachment: scrolls with the page or stays fixed. <br>
  background-origin: which box the position is measured from. <br>
  background-clip: which area gets painted (border-box, padding-box, content-box). <br>
  background: shorthand to set several of these at once. <br>
  <br>

  <h1>Q3) Dimensions vs resolution (one sentence)</h1> <br>
  Dimensions are the width and height in pixels and resolution is how many pixels there are per unit length. <br>
  <br>

  <h1>Extra credit: formats (GIF, PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, SVG)</h1> <br>
  GIF: supports simple animations, limited colors, file size can be bigger than newer formats. <br>
  PNG: lossless, supports transparency, great for crisp edges and UI art. <br>
  JPG/JPEG: lossy, great for photos, smaller than PNG for photos but not ideal for sharp graphics or text. <br>
  WebP: modern format, supports lossy and lossless, transparency, and animation, often smaller than JPG/PNG for similar quality. <br>
  SVG: vector graphics, scale cleanly at any size, great for icons, logos, and diagrams. <br>
