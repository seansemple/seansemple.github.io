<h1 id="q1">How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h1>
<h2> A CSS media query is something you add after @media. This enables the browsers to only apply styles inside if the viewport or the device you are using matches. <br> This is instrumental in responsive design.</h2>


<h1 id="q2">What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</h1>
<h2>Max-width/min-width: Target screens with dimensional values and change layouts at breakpoints. <br>
    Pointer: Tells us if the primary pointer is precise or imprecise so you can adjust hit targets or effects that hover.<br>
    Orientation: Determines if viewport is in portrait or landscape so it can change the style accordingly.<br>
    Prefers-reduced-motion: Determines if the user prefers less animation, thereby reducing motion effects to improve user accessibility.
